- I am a undergraduate majoring in automation and trying to be a hacker. 
- Familiar with Python, R, C, and learning Ruby.
- Kind of keen on reading. I am a big fan of Márquez, and his *Crónica de una muerte anunciada* is best novel I've ever read. Also I love Wang Xiaobo, John Berger, Walt Whitman and Paul Celan et al.
- Amateurs of LOL ARAM(All Random All Mid)
- If you find anything interesting about who I am or what I do, you can contract me by ***[[email::redb3an@gamil.com]]***. Or if you are not comfortable reaching out to me directly, you can also anonymously give me [[feedback::https://www.admonymous.co/raghuveerdotnet]]
